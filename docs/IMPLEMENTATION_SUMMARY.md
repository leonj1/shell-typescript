# Shell Architecture Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the shell architecture implementation based on the specification.

## Packages Implemented

### @shell/interfaces
- Contains all TypeScript interfaces defining the contracts between the shell and business modules
- Includes interfaces for:
  - Authentication (IAuthProvider)
  - Authorization (IAuthorizationService)
  - Logging (ILogger)
  - Telemetry (ITelemetryProvider)
  - Business modules (IBusinessModule)
  - Service container (IServiceContainer)

### @shell/core
- Core implementation of the shell architecture
- Includes:
  - Service container implementation using InversifyJS
  - Service scope management
  - Configuration manager
  - Module loader
  - React service provider component
  - React hooks for service injection
  - Implementations of core services:
    - WinstonLogger (logging)
    - Auth0Provider (authentication)
    - RBACAuthorizationService (authorization)
    - DatadogTelemetryProvider (telemetry)

### @shell/cli
- CLI tool for generating business modules
- Includes:
  - Commander.js based CLI structure
  - Module creation command
  - Template system for new modules

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation between core business logic and infrastructure implementations
2. **Dependency Injection**: Service container using InversifyJS with support for singleton, transient, and scoped services
3. **Service Resolution**: React hooks for resolving services in components
4. **Module Loading**: Dynamic module loading system
5. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration loading
6. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between shell and business modules
7. **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston implementation
8. **Authentication**: Auth0 provider implementation
9. **Authorization**: RBAC authorization service
10. **Telemetry**: Datadog telemetry provider

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows the hexagonal architecture pattern with:

- **Ports**: Defined in the @shell/interfaces package
- **Adapters**: Implemented in the @shell/core package
- **Core**: Business logic repository (represented by the module system)

Services are managed through a dependency injection container, allowing business modules to declare their dependencies without knowing the specific implementations.

## Usage Examples

The implementation includes several examples demonstrating:
- Basic service container usage
- Module creation and loading
- React component integration with service provider
- CLI tool usage for generating new modules

## Build System

All packages can be compiled with TypeScript using the provided build script.
